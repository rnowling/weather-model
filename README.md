weather-model
=============

Model for local weather including temperature, precipitation (total, snowfall, rainfall), wind speed, and wind chill.  Model is parameterized and compared to NOAA QCLCD data.  Model will eventually be included in the BigPetStore data generator and as such, includes changes to the BPS purchasing model to account for the impact the weather has on purchasing habits.
